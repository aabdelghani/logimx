# NotLogi

NotLogi sets up MX mice and keyboards on Linux, with Windows and macOS in beta. Choose what every
button and key does, open an **action ring** of your favourite actions around the pointer, and use
one mouse and keyboard across several computers with **Flow**. It works on GNOME, KDE and other
desktops, on X11 and Wayland.

NotLogi is an independent project. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the
manufacturer of these devices.

## Install

Download from the [latest release](https://github.com/aabdelghani/notlogi/releases/latest).

- **Ubuntu / Debian**: `sudo apt install ./logimx_0.12.1_amd64.deb`, then open NotLogi from the app grid.
- **Any Linux**: make the AppImage executable and run it.
- **Windows 10 and 11** (beta): run the setup. If SmartScreen asks, choose **More info**, then
  **Run anyway**.
- **macOS 12 or newer** (beta): open the .dmg and drag NotLogi to Applications (signed and
  notarized, so it opens like any app), then allow **Accessibility** and **Input Monitoring** when asked.

Quit Logi Options+, Solaar or logiops while NotLogi runs: they drive the same buttons.

## Features

### Flow

One mouse and keyboard for several computers (Linux and macOS; Windows untested). Move the pointer
off the edge of the screen and it carries on on the next computer, with the keyboard and the
clipboard.

- Set up in three steps: install NotLogi on both, pair the mouse on another channel, same network
- Drag the computers' screens to where they sit
- Switch at the edge, or only while holding Ctrl

### Action ring

Hold a button, flick toward an action, let go. Up to eight actions around the pointer.

- Click a slot to pick its action, or drag one onto it
- **Folders**: put more actions behind one slot; they open on a second circle around the ring
- Several ring profiles, and a different ring per application
- Volume and brightness: hold and drag to set the level
- Small, medium or large

### MX Master 4

- Haptic feedback with its strength, felt as the action ring moves
- The haptic panel as a button of its own (it opens the action ring out of the box)
- How hard the panel has to be pressed, and the wheel's ratchet force
- Easy-Switch on a photo of its underside

## Wishes and problems

**Make a wish** or **Report an issue** from the home screen. A report fills in what is needed and
leaves out personal details; it is filed from your own GitHub account.

## How it works

A small background agent talks to the devices; the app is its settings window.

Building from source, the command line and the technical details are in
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md).
